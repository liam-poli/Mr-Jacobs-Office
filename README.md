# Mr. Jacobs' Office

**J.A.C.O.B.S.** — Just Another Corporate Office Behavior System

A multiplayer AI social simulation game where "Among Us meets Severance." You and 3 other players are trapped in an infinite, glitchy 80s office simulation run by **Mr. Jacobs**, an unhinged AI boss.

Do your job. Earn Bucks. Talk to the boss. Escape — or sacrifice your coworkers trying.

Built for the [Supercell Global AI Game Hackathon](https://discord.gg/bQ29YpdQ75) (February 2026).
