​In the context of this hackathon, “AI” means Generative AI (GenAI), though traditional games AI can be mixed in. While we have some tools available, you can use any tools you want! You cover your own tool expenses → remember to remove API keys before sharing or submitting code.

​You are not allowed to use any of your own material made before the hackathon. When submitting, you ensure that all submission material is original and free of third-party restrictions. 

​All projects are open-sourced under the MIT License, meaning anyone can build upon and commercialize your work, as long as they credit the original creators. 

​You can submit to multiple challenges, but can only win in one. In an event where you are voted first in multiple challenges, the hackathon organizers will evaluate which challenge your submission fits the best.

​Wishing you the best of Luck and Happy Hacking!!
